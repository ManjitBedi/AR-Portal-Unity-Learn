# AR-Portal-Unity-Learn

- example project based on a tutorial on [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/instantiate-the-portal-on-a-plane)

- the project is using sample assets from Unity & also from David O'Reilly which are licensed creative commons

## Instructions 

- export the app for Android or iOS
- it has only been tested on iOS

- the app is set to do horizontal plane detections
- when a plane is detected it will appear in green
- tap on the plane & a portal appears showing content through the portal
- the portal effect is achieved using a custom shader, URP setting with stencils; this is explained in [more detail on the Unity Learn web-site](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/limit-the-visibility-of-the-portal-world?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=63e3a4c1edbc2a344bfe21d8&missionId=63f77ca2edbc2a007912d446&projectId=637b7ca6edbc2a48fd44b353)
